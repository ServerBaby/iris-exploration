# iris-exploration

Data science activity on the Iris data set.

1.	Set up a Git Repository for this activity on https://github.com/. 

2.	Using Python, R, Jupyter load the ‘Iris’ dataset. 
a.	If using Python: use the sklearn package https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/datasets/plot_iris_dataset.html
b.	If using R: use the data/datasets library 

3.	Perform Exploratory Data Analysis on the Iris dataset. Create visualisations of your choice and comment on any insights/trends.

4.	Store your code on the git repository you have created and provide a link to your repository.

5.	Describe the steps and checks you would take to prepare this dataset for a machine learning model and provide comments on any challenges you may face in modelling.
